## Moore's Law

### Clock speeds double every 18 months to 3-years

Therefore you can expect performance to double every 2 years - NO LONGER TRUE
Number of transistors that can be placed on a die doubles every 18 months to 3 years - SLOWING DOWN NOW BUT NOT PROBABLY TRUE FOR A WHILE LONGER

10^9 - gigahertz
10^10 - terahertz
